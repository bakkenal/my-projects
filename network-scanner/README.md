This is a network scanner. Scan.py takes in two inputs, a file of inputs (format given in test examples), and the name of the output file, and writes a bunch of 
network information it finds to the output file as a json. The report.py takes in a output file from scan.py and an output file where it should write the report, and formats the
information from the scanner into something readable.
